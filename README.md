### Hi, I am Alex! 👋 🦄

As a developer, I can generate solutions to problems on the front end with good practices and a scalable software architecture. I am meticulous with my work; I like creating animations and modeling pixel-perfect apps. I also have back-end knowledge working with non-relational databases, creating Apis with Node.js and Typescript. I like teamwork because it is a way to build great things nimbly.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Pets Love web app and mobile app open source for adopting pets.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with Dapp front-end.
- 🌱 I’m currently learning AWS and Solidity.
- 🤔 I’m looking for help in open source projects.
- 🌱 I love plants.
- 🏔️ I love climbing
