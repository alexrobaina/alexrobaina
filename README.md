### Hi world ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¦„

As a developer I can generate solutions to problems on the front-end with good practices and a scalable software architecture. I am meticulous with my work, I like creating animations, and modeling pixel perfect apps.

I also have back-end knowledge working with non-relational databases, creating Apis with Node.js with Typescript. 

I like teamwork. Working as a team seems important to me because it's a way to build great things nimbly.
