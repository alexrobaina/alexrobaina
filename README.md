### Hi, I'm Alex! 👋 🦄

As a developer, I can generate solutions to problems on the front end with good practices and scalable software architecture. I am meticulous with my work; I like creating animations and modeling pixel-perfect apps. I also have back-end knowledge working with non-relational databases, making Apis with Node.js and Typescript. I enjoy teamwork because it is a way to build great things nimbly.

- 🔭 I’m currently working on Pet's Love web app, open source for adopting pets.
- 👯 I’m looking to collaborate with Dapp front-end.
- 🌱 I’m interested in blockchain.
- 🌱 I love plants.
- 🏔️ I love climbing in the rocks and mountains
