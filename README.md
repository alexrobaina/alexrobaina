### Hi world ðŸ‘‹ ðŸ¦„

As a developer, I can generate solutions to problems on the front-end with good practices and a scalable software architecture. I am meticulous with my work, I like creating animations, and modeling pixel perfect apps. I also have back-end knowledge working with non-relational databases, creating Apis with Node.js and Typescript. I like teamwork because it is a way to build great things nimbly.

- ðŸ‘¯  Iâ€™m looking to collaborate on biology software and front-end Dapp
